#Registration Database CRUD Operations
This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a SQLite database for a registration system. The code allows you to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting registration records.

Requirements
Python 3
SQLite (for storing registration data locally)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/registration-database-crud.git
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

No additional installation is required as SQLite comes pre-installed with Python.

Usage
Run the SQL.py script to perform CRUD operations:

python SQL.py
The script demonstrates the following operations:

Create: Creates a new registration record with provided details.
Read: Retrieves a registration record based on the provided registration ID.
Update: Updates an existing registration record with new details.
Delete: Deletes a registration record based on the provided registration ID.
